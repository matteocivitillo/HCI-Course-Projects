# Human–Computer Interaction - Course Portfolio  
This repository contains the three major assignments completed for the Human–Computer Interaction course (EIT Digital Master School).  
The work covers theoretical foundations, analytical skills, UX research, prototyping, and user-centred evaluation.

## 📘 Assignment 1 - Comparative HCI Evaluation  
**Topics:** Context of use, usability, interaction, UX, ISO standards  
**What I did:**  
- Analyzed one digital product (Microsoft Teams) and one physical product (an Air Fryer)  
- Applied key HCI concepts (context of use, UI, usability, UX)  
- Compared interaction models and identified design challenges and opportunities  
**What I learned:**  
- Systematically applying HCI principles to heterogeneous products  
- Structuring evaluations between digital and physical interfaces  
- Identifying mismatches between intended and actual user experience

## 📙 Assignment 2 - Mental Models & UI Redesign  
**Topics:** Mental models, metaphors, gulfs of execution/evaluation, interface redesign  
**What I did:**  
- Studied Gmail’s interaction model using mental models and metaphor theory  
- Identified misalignments between the user’s conceptual model and system behavior  
- Proposed redesign sketches to improve task clarity and reduce cognitive load  
**What I learned:**  
- How mental models shape interaction success  
- How to identify usability gaps through normative HCI frameworks  
- How to propose targeted UI improvements grounded in theory

## 📗 Assignment 3 - SmaWat: Child-Centered Smartwatch Design  
**Topics:** ISO 9241-210, HCD process, prototyping, evaluation, UX for children  
**What I did:**  
- Created paper prototypes and mid-high fidelity Figma prototypes  
- Designed scenarios, tasks, UI interactions, and gamified elements  
- Planned formative (Wizard-of-Oz) and summative evaluations  
- Addressed cognitive abilities, accessibility, child safety, and parental constraints  
**What I learned:**  
- Applying the full HCD process iteratively  
- Designing interfaces for children with real-world constraints  
- Combining qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods

## 🧠 Skills demonstrated across the three assignments  
- UX research & analysis (context of use, task analysis, mental models)  
- HCI theory applied to real systems  
- Prototyping (sketches, paper prototypes, Figma flows)  
- Human-centred design process (ISO 9241-210)  
- Qualitative evaluation (observation, WoZ, think-aloud)  
- Quantitative evaluation (metrics, success rates, tasks)
